                Throughout my career, I have implemented problem solutions using a wide
                range of technologies and software stacks, such as
                Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP, J2EE application servers, microservice-based
                architectures, cloud functions, NoSQL databases, blockchains, and dApps.

            <p>
                While I am proficient in OOP/OOD and the imperative paradigm, my current
                interest lies in strongly-typed functional programming, specifically
                Haskell, PureScript, and Scala.

                Lead Software Engineer @
                <a href="https://bellroy.com/">Bellroy.com</a> (08/2019 &ndash; 01/2022)
            </h3>

            <p>
                Bellroy is an e-commerce company with its own tech platform, originally
                built in Ruby on Rails and hosted on AWS EC2 servers. As the company
                grew, the Rails way was no longer sufficient to manage the complexity of
                the systems. After success with the purely functional frontend language
                Elm, the tech leadership decided to pivot to using Haskell as the
                principal technology stack.
            </p>

            <p>
                I joined Bellroy as a lead software engineer to kick off a Haskell
                development team, establish best practices, and build software
                infrastructure. Here are some of the decisions I made and achievements I
                accomplished in this role:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        I bet on serverless infrastructure: The first service I developed
                        used AWS Lambda and was integrated with the legacy systems. Since
                        then, the number of serverless services has grown from 0 to 6, where
                        each service consists of a number of Lambda functions. So far, these
                        new systems have been faster, more stable, and more maintainable.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

                    <p>
                        I have led a 5-day on-site FP course to my colleagues and have
                        supported their learning process ever since. Two more colleagues
                        have since joined full-time Haskell development (and growing).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        As a team, we developed a compiler framework for strongly-typed,
                        composable e-commerce domain-specific language compilers. Currently,
                        there are four DSLs used within the company to manage aspects of
                        shipping logistics and product promotions.

                        The Bellroy platform was growing horizontally, and I advised on best
                        practices to gracefully and gradually transition from a monolithic
                        to a distributed system architecture.

                <h4>Numara Software (now acquired by BMC software)</h4>

                <p> I performed the role of senior Java developer in the project named “Footprints” which is a ITIL®
                    V3-compatible solution for consolidating and automating business processes within and beyond the IT
                    organization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Had daily meetings and design sessions with teams that were situated in Colombia and USA (Florida).
                    Had business trip to USA where participated in different dev kick-off and design sessions.
                    Worked in the team that was responsible for development of the prototype at the prototyping phase
                    and development of the business and application frameworks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lately has been promoted to Application Framework Feature Lead.
                    Gained new experience with ExtJS (Sencha) and Microsoft Team Foundation Server.
                </p>

                <h4>GreenLink Networks</h4>

                <p>
                    I took part in the development of the “Advanced Loyalty Program” multi-portal web application that
                    provides media broadcasting corporations with the loyalty program tool: while the audience has an
                    attractive point-n-click portal there are sophisticated management and reporting tools on the
                    administrative and program partner portals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Used tools and framework like JBoss AS, JBoss Cache, JMS, EJB, Spring Framework, Oracle DB, Apache
                    OfBiz, Hibernate, Web services. Used various agile practices on a daily basis.
                </p>

                <h4>Internal research project</h4>

                <p>
                    Semantic Similarity component has been developed by me as a research project in order to determine
                    how effectively semantic networks like WordNET and Wikipedia could be used to calculate a semantic
                    similarity between words using different graph traversal algorithms.
                </p>
                <p>Was solely responsible for the development.</p>
                <p>
                    The main challenge was to make program work fast on a big amounts of data without excessive memory
                    usage. I achieved this with preprocessing and storing intermediate results in a binary cache.
                    I worked in tight cooperation with a language scientist from Ukrainian university.

                <p>
                    Our team developed a clustered and load-balanced solution to serve Internet social network with a
                    VoIP
                    functionality based on Skype.
                    I developed an original Java Applet that was using native Windows Skype API and was exposing it to a
                    JavaScript
                    in the user browser so that it was possible to make calls and chats from the web page UI using Skype
                    as a
                    transport.
                    At the server-side a hardware load balancer and several machines with JBoss AS have been used to
                    serve lots

                    UK based Zubka is a job referral site where one can actually earn cash by recommending his mates for
                    jobs. I
                    have joined this project as a Lead PHP developer.
                    At the time I joined there was a lot of legacy and buggy code written in PHP version 4.
                    I have adopted/rewritten all the legacy code so it became compatible with a PHP version 5 and
                    together with
                    deployment of a bytecode optimizer it greatly accelerated the site.
