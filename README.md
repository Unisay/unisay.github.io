## Summary

Software developer with over 20 years of experience designing, developing, and
delivering software solutions in a variety of domains, including web, NLP, big
data with machine learning, e-commerce, edu-tech, and blockchain.

Throughout my career, I have implemented problem solutions using a wide range of
technologies and software stacks, such as Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP, J2EE
application servers, microservice-based architectures, cloud functions, NoSQL
databases, blockchains, and dApps.

While I am proficient in OOP/OOD and the imperative paradigm, my current
interest lies in strongly-typed functional programming, specifically Haskell,
PureScript, and Scala.

## Work experience

### Senior Software Engineer @ [Cardano Foundation](https://cardano-foundation.org/) (06/2023 - now)

The Cardano Foundation is an independent, Swiss-based not-for-profit
organization tasked with advancing the public digital infrastructure of the
Cardano Blockchain. I continued working as a Cardano Wallet code contributor,
along with the other open-source projects within the ecosystem.

### Senior Software Engineer @ [Input-Output Global](https://iog.io/) (02/2022 - 06/2023)

Input-Output Global (IOG) is a company behind the Cardano Blockchain project. I
worked here as a full-time code contributor, maintaining the open-source project
[Cardano Wallet](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-wallet) (the
primary full-node wallet of the Cardano blockchain network).

### Lead Software Engineer @ [Bellroy.com](https://bellroy.com/) (08/2019 – 01/2022)

Bellroy is an e-commerce company with its own tech platform, originally built in
Ruby on Rails and hosted on AWS EC2 servers. As the company grew, the Rails way
was no longer sufficient to manage the complexity of the systems. After success
with the purely functional frontend language Elm, the tech leadership decided to
pivot to using Haskell as the principal technology stack.

I joined Bellroy as a lead software engineer to kick off a Haskell development
team, establish best practices, and build software infrastructure. Here are some
of the decisions I made and achievements I accomplished in this role:

- I bet on serverless infrastructure: The first service I developed used AWS
  Lambda and was integrated with the legacy systems. Since then, the number of
  serverless services has grown from 0 to 6, where each service consists of a
  number of Lambda functions. So far, these new systems have been faster, more
  stable, and more maintainable.

- I organized a 5-day on-site FP course to my colleagues and have supported
  their learning process ever since. Two more colleagues have since joined
  full-time Haskell development (and growing).

- As a team, we developed a compiler framework for strongly-typed, composable
  e-commerce domain-specific language compilers. Currently, there are four DSLs
  used within the company to manage aspects of shipping logistics and product
  promotions.

- The Bellroy platform was growing horizontally, and I advised on best practices
  to gracefully and gradually transition from a monolithic to a distributed
  system architecture.

### Senior Software Engineer, Team Lead @ [CollegeVine.com](https://www.collegevine.com/) (11/2018 – 07/2019)

As a software engineer at CollegeVine, I developed back-end and front-end
software, led a small team, and collaborated with product and UX specialists to
manage requirements, tasks, and demos. My latest achievement was developing a UI
test automation framework that significantly reduced manual UI testing time.

### Lead Software Engineer @ [DSTOQ.com](https://dstoq.com/) (04/2018 – 11/2018)

At DSTOQ, I was one of the first engineers hired and helped shape the tech
vision for the platform. I designed the tech architecture and security
foundation, coordinated external contractors, conducted tech interviews, and
developed mission-critical components in Haskell with extensive property-based
tests. I also contributed the Haskell Stellar SDK to open source.

### Senior Software Engineer @ [Zalando.de](https://www.zalando.de/) (06/2015 – 03/2018)

As a software engineer at Zalando, Europe's largest online fashion retailer, I
played a key role in developing a platform solution for merchants and partners.
I was actively involved in technical architecture decision-making processes and
participated in hiring and interviewing new talent. My most recent
accomplishment was the integration of miadidas.com into the Zalando shop, where
I single-handedly developed both the frontend and backend in collaboration with
Adidas colleagues.

### Senior Software Engineer @ [Groupon.com](https://www.groupon.com/) (02/2013 – 06/2015)

Groupon is the largest local-deal aggregator in the world, where I developed
software that applies machine learning algorithms to big data in two ways: batch
processing and real-time search relevance. We implemented a lambda architecture
for big data. My latest achievement is developing a reactive distributed data
indexer.

### Lead Software Engineer @ [Rule Financial](http://www.rulefinancial.com/) (03/2012 – 08/2012)

Rule Financial is a fintech consultancy company where I led a team to develop
the Prime Transaction Manager product for Barclays Capital Bank. In addition to
project management, my main achievement was refactoring a large legacy (10+
years) codebase and improving deployment procedures.
